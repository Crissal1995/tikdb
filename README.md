# tikdb
A simple script to obtain a zip to be put into WiiU USB Helper.
## Guide
- If you're gonna use the script (`tikdb.m`), then you need Matlab (paid, or free if you're an academic or researcher);
- If you're gonna use the executable (`tikdb_installer.exe`, just for Windows right now), then you just need to start the installer and let it download the Matlab Runtime mandatory for using the script.

A Python version is coming (ETA: -1 hour).

By the way the exe is fine, it's made with Matlab Compiler, but if you don't trust it you can check it out with VirusTotal [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9a07bc4b68231dfd8a79ac1583fec87fcf5d3cd3f927d3cb877e601f9d8ececc/detection) or your antivirus.
