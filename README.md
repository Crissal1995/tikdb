# tikdb
A simple script to obtain a zip to be put into WiiU USB Helper
## Requirements
The script is built with Matlab 2018b, so you will require Matlab (paid or free if you're an academic or researcher) or [Matlab Runtime](https://mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) (it's free) for Matlab 2018b or higher in order to run it.
## Guide
Just run the script into the console; after a while, a zip called `tikdb.zip` will be created.
